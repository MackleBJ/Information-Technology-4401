This programming challenge begins with the program you wrote for the Object Position Calculation challenge and incorporates additional requirements.

Here are the requirements from the first programming assignment:

The final position, 𝑥𝑓, of an object that has an initial position 𝑥0, an initial velocity 𝑣0, and an acceleration of 𝑎 after a time 𝑡 has passed is given by the
formula:

𝑥𝑓=𝑥0+𝑣0𝑡+12𝑎𝑡2

Write a python program called “objectposncalc.py” that accepts user input from the keyboard for the initial position, initial velocity, acceleration, and time that
has passed and outputs the final position based on the above equation.


Here are the additional requirements for this programming assignment:
User input may not cause the program to crash. Exceptions from invalid user input must be handled gracefully. The user is to be given feedback about invalid input
and given the opportunity to supply the input without needing to run the program again.

Negative elapsed times are not to be accepted from the user. If a negative time is provided the user is to be given feedback and asked again for the time. Other 
inputs are to be allowed to be negative, zero, or positive. Only elapsed times are to be restricted to 0 and positive values.

After each calculation the user is to be prompted if they want to perform another calculation. If they answer with a “y” then they are to be prompted for new input 
and another calculation is to be performed. If they provide any other response the program is to exit.

Make sure you read the Interactive Input and Exception Handling document in its entirety before doing this assignment.

Testing
Once you have written your program you need to test it. Choose values for inputs and get the result the program generates. Then, outside of the program using a 
calculator or hand calculation verify that the result is correct. Do this for several sets of input values. If you don’t get the same answer figure out why and 
fix the problem. Provide invalid inputs and check that the program correctly handles the invalid inputs. Check that inputs to the prompt to perform another 
calculation are properly handled for a range of values.

Submission
Put your objectposncalc.py file in a folder named ImprovedObjectPosnCalc and zip the folder. The zip file is to be submitted for this assignment.
